Learning Svelte by building a poker game.

Now featuring WebAssembly! Ever wondered how to Shoehorn more Rust into a simple frontend project? Look no further than WASM!

<h3>To Do</h3>
<ul>
    <li>[*] Basic card dealing</li>
    <li>[*] Basic poker hand evaluation</li>
    <li>[*] Flop, River and Turn Simulations </li>
    <li>[ ] Cleaner UI</li>
    <hr>Planned
    <li>[ ] State Management for Tables. Thinking of using hooks.server.js to load table info into locals vs doing it client side</li>
    <li>[ ] Game loop - maybe WASM?</li>
</ul>
