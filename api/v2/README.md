<h2>This is now part of the Svoker codebase</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>The codebase for my Svoker game is growing, and while I'm really having a ton of fun building something I love doing in real life (playing poker), the API is a complete mess. 
Naturally. I wanted to seperate out the Go API from the main project, for a number of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I want to work on what I think is going to end up the main driver of the game logic seperately</li>
<li>I want to show that Go is my main backend language at the moment</li>
<li>I want to show that I can write a clean API</li>
<li>I want to show that I can write unit tests</li>
<li>I'm actually quite proud of this refactor. It does everything the current API does in half the code!</li>
</ul>
